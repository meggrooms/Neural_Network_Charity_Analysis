#### Preprocessing Data
<BR>
• Variable(s) considered the target(s) for the model
<BR>
• Variable(s) considered to be the features for the model
<BR>
• Variables removed from input data as they are neither targets nor features
<BR>
<BR>
  
#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
<BR>
• Nuerons, Layers, and activation functions selected for the neural network model & why
<BR>
There were 108 import features. I used 3 hidden layers as following:
<BR>
Layer 1: 60 
• Ability to achieve target model performance
<BR>
Target performance was 75%, the best I was able to achieve was 73%
Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?
